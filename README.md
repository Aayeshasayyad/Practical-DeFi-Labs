## Introduction

DeFi represents a new wave of financial services that operate without traditional intermediaries. This repository offers a series of labs that allow you to interact with popular DeFi platforms. You can engage with these tools without needing any coding skills. 

## What is DeFi?

Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is a movement aimed at creating an open-source, permissionless financial system. It utilizes blockchain technology to eliminate the need for central authorities, enabling peer-to-peer transactions. Key features of DeFi include:

- **Lending and Borrowing**: Users can lend their assets and earn interest or borrow against their assets.
- **Decentralized Exchanges**: Platforms like Uniswap allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without a centralized authority.
- **Staking and Yield Farming**: Users can earn rewards by participating in network activities.

## Getting Started

To begin, you will need a few tools:

1. **MetaMask**: A browser extension that acts as a wallet for managing your cryptocurrencies.
2. **Testnets**: These are blockchain environments that allow you to practice without using real funds.

### Install MetaMask

1. Go to the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/).
2. Download the extension for your browser.
3. Create a new wallet and follow the prompts to set it up.

### Connect to Testnets

You can connect MetaMask to various testnets like Ropsten, Rinkeby, or Binance Smart Chain Testnet. This will allow you to experiment without the risk of losing real money.
